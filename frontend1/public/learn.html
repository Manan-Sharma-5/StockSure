            <p class="word">Market capitalization, or market cap, is a measure of a company's total value in the stock market. It is calculated by multiplying the company's current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. Market cap determines the size of a company and is used to categorize companies into different classifications such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. It reflects the market's perception of a company's worth and is an important metric for investors to consider when evaluating investment opportunities. </p>

            <p class="word">The volume of a stock refers to the total number of shares that are traded within a specific period, typically a day. It represents the level of activity and liquidity in the market for that particular stock. Volume is an important indicator as it helps determine the level of interest and participation in a stock. Higher volume generally indicates greater market interest, while lower volume suggests limited trading activity. Volume is often used in technical analysis to confirm trends, identify potential price reversals, and gauge the overall strength of a stock's price movement.</p>
